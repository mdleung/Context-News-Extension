<h1>Jennifer Aniston reveals shocking 'Friends' romance: â€˜We channeled our love'</h1>
<h3>By Lauren Sarner | May 27, 2021 | 3:00am</h3>
<p>Turns out the small screen's biggest love affair wasn't just a must-see-TV fantasy.</p>
<p>David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston dropped a major bombshell in the &quot;Friends: The Reunion&quot; special on HBO Max: Ross and Rachel's tortured sexual chemistry on NBC's legendary Thursday night sitcom actually spilled over into real life.</p>
<p>Yes, break or no break” these turned on co-stars were totally hot for each other.</p>
<p>&quot;The first season, I had a major crush on Jen,&quot; Schwimmer, 54, admits during the much-hyped unscripted celebration. &quot;At some point we were both crushing hard on each other but it was like two ships passing [in the night], because one of us was always in a relationship.</p>
<p>&quot;We never crossed that boundary, we respected that,&quot; Schwimmer claims, much to the foul-mouthed skepticism of one of his castmates but more on that later.</p>
<p>Aniston, 52, backs up Schwimmer's stunning confession, before they both go into deeper detail about their steamy on-set make-out sessions and whether or not their co-stars were in on the long-simmering secret.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember saying at one point to David, 'It's going to be such a bummer if the first time you and I actually kiss is on national television!' Sure enough, the first time we kissed was in that coffee shop,&quot; Aniston says. &quot;So we just channeled all of our adoration and love for each other into Ross and Rachel.&quot;</p>
<p>The reunion, which was delayed for months by COVID-19 and premiered Thursday on HBO Max, brought together actors Schwimmer, Aniston, Courteney Cox, 56; Lisa Kudrow, 57; Matt LeBlanc, 53; and Matthew Perry, 51, to reflect on the show's status in pop culture and to offer juicy behind-the-scenes secrets. (Hey, they weren't paid a reported $2.5 to $3 million each for nothing, folks.)</p>
<p>The sure-to-stun-fans revelation by Schwimmer and Aniston was prompted by a &quot;cheeky&quot; observation from controversial host James Corden, who says, &quot;You were all young, hot, good-looking, successful actors. It's inconceivable to me that there weren't perhaps off-screen romances.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, LeBlanc revels in stirring the passion (uh, lobster?) pot. In response to Schwimmer's suggestion that he and Aniston kept things platonic off-camera, LeBlanc coughs and blurts, &quot;Bullshit!&quot; then laughs and says, &quot;I'm kidding!&quot;</p>
<p>Could they be any more evasive?</p>
<p>However, Schwimmer goes on to admit, &quot;There were moments we would cuddle on a couch&quot; with Aniston teasing in reply, &quot;We would spoon and fall asleep on the couch.&quot; Plus, fellow &quot;Friends&quot; cast members Cox and Perry confirm that they were aware of lovelorn Aniston and Schwimmer's feelings for each other.</p>
<p>When their hot crushes officially got lit and how long they burned is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>But let's break this down a tiny bit: Ross and Rachel's first kiss happens in the Season 2 episode &quot;The One Where Ross Finds Out,&quot; which aired on Nov. 9, 1995.</p>
<p>And Aniston allegedly had her first date with beau Brad Pitt, 57, in 1998. (They married in 2000 and infamously split up in 2005.)</p>
<p>However, Aniston once told Rolling Stone that they first met in 1994, putting Pitt squarely in the timeframe she said she had been hoping to smooch Schwimmer. &quot;Friends&quot; aired from 1994 to 2004.</p>
