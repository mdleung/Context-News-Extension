<h1>Ruth Graham, daughter of evangelist Billy Graham, teaching W.Va. inmates about forgiveness</h1>

<p>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. Ruth Graham, daughter of evangelist Billy Graham, is teaching inmates at Huttonsville Correctional Center about the issue of forgiveness.</p>
<p>In addition to West Virginia, Graham is also teaching forgiveness to inmates in Mississippi, but before she could do this she had to come to terms with her own forgiveness issues.</p>
<p>&quot;He really loved each of his children unconditionally, and he was a wonderful father, but he was just gone,&quot; Graham, said of her father, Billy Graham.</p>
<p>At times she said it wasn't easy growing up as Billy Graham's daughter, who was gone from the family for weeks at a time.</p>
<p>&quot;My father was my hero,&quot; she said. &quot;I would never want to blame him and don't blame him. I was feeling insecure because my father wasn't home. As a little girl I wanted him to tuck me in bed at night. I wanted him to teach me how to ride a bicycle, but he wasn't home. I read that in my little girls heart as abandonment and I had to deal with that and forgive my father.&quot;</p>
<p>She said her dad passed away before she could talk with him about her feelings. Her road to forgiveness is outlined in her book &quot;Forgiving My Father, Forgiving Myself,&quot; and through Zoom she is teaching inmates at Huttonsville Correctional Center about the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;They have to forgive themselves and by in large those that come into these classes have wrestled with that issue and wrestled with the fact that they have wounded someone deeply, but they also have the opportunity to ask for forgiveness,&quot; Graham said.</p>
<p>Catalyst Ministries in Charleston is sponsoring the classes.</p>
<p>&quot;What we try to do at Catalyst is focus on the moral fiber of an individual, where education focusses on the education and we work on the moral fiber and forgiveness is part of that,&quot; Calvin Sutphin, founder and president of Catalyst Ministries, said.</p>
<p>Graham said ministering to inmates has become a big part of Ruth Graham Ministries, and will always remember corresponding with a crime victim after meeting the perpetrator on death row in Louisiana.</p>
<p>&quot;She replied that he had murdered her granddaughter in a brutal way some years ago, and she wanted to know that he would be in heaven with her,&quot; Graham said.</p>
<p>Looking down from heaven, what would the Rev. Billy Graham think about his daughter's prison ministry and book?</p>
<p>&quot;I think he would be thrilled,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Graham's classes in West Virginia and Mississippi end in August. She said she would like to expand the classes to other states.</p>
